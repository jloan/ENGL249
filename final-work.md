#### Finishing the Course

##### e249 | SP19 | Electronic LIterature | Jason Loan

#### Your Work

# Part 1

What would you still like to learn/do? In finishing up the quarter, your work is to decide on a final project.

### Possible projects could include: 

* returning to a previous project to make substantive revisions to the current draft; 
* drafting an entirely new work in one of the genres we've already worked in; 
* attempt to draft a project in a genre of eliterature that we haven't experimented with yet. 

Possible projects are not limited to these options. I am open to any project variation that extends from an intersection of your personal learning outcomes and the outcomes of the course. 

# Part 2

Assempble all your projects into a final portfolio.

The design of these is realtively straight-forward. 

For each project:
Link to the final version of the project.
For each project draft an [artist's statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist's_statement).

You have a few options for publishing this colection of your work.

1. Publish it within the context of your research log.
2. Publish you works as part of a public profile on a site like [itch.io](https://itch.io/) or other sharing platform.


# Part 3 (Optional)

### Looking ahead to Spring 2020

I will be teaching this class again in the Spring of 2020. I would love for you to help me design the syllabus for this next time.

For example...

* What should we be sure to read? (what did you come across in your work this quarter that you found particularly interesting?)
* What resources did you find that were particularly helpful? Did you come across a tutorial or some other things that really helped you in the course of a project?
* Do you have any ideas for different projects that we might explore in a future version of the class?

These are just a few areas, I'd love to hear from you about.

Add your thoughts to this working draft of [a future syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxb2dJdATFXeZwi8LKdayj2nH9ZZUUNWO-fgHuKdmd0/edit?usp=sharing).


#### Timeline/Deadlines

All final projects and portfolios **DUE** June 14.
