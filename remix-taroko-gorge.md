#### Project 1: Remixing Taroko Gorge 

##### e249 | SP19 | Electronic LIterature | Jason Loan

Nick Monfort's poem "Taroko Gorge" has invited many remixes.

As a way into experimenting with computer poetry, or as Monfort might call them  -- "poetry generating machines," we will be producing our own remixes of "Taroko Gorge."

#### How will we do this?

As both aspiring poets/creative writers *and* non-programmers we will initially accomplish our remixes by *leaving Monfort's original code alone*. We will focus, instead, on changing the words that Monfort's code uses to generate the poem in order to make a new poem *about* something else. 

For example, here is Scott Rettenberg's Intro to his 2009 remix of Monfort's poem titled ["Tokyo Garbage"](http://retts.net/tokyogarage.html):

> This here is a total remix of the classic and elegant generated nature poem Tokoro Gorge by Nick Montfort. He wrote the code here. I hacked the words to make it more about urbanity, modernity, and my idea of Tokyo, a city I have never been to. Remixed March 18, 2009 by Scott Rettberg.

In "hacking" Monforts words, but leaving the original code unchanged, Rettenberg was able produce a new poem about "urbanity, modernity, and my idea of Tokyo, a city [he] had never been to." 

Other remixes of "TG" have follwoed this path -- leaving the code in tact but hacking the words to create an entirely new poem. That is your challenge in this project.

#### Timeline/Deadlines

TH [April 18th] -- Initial Modifictions DUE. IN this initial phase. Play around with hacking Monforts words in order to get a feel for how the poem works.

TH [April 25th] -- Final remixes DUE. 

#### Submitting the project

Projects should be submitted an html file. Your file, like Rettenberg's rmeix file should include a brief description of your remix. As this is probably the first time you've "hacked" and html file or submitted one in the cntext of school -- I will provide a template for this.
