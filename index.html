    <p><em>“…the goal of [electronic literature] remains consistent: to manipulate language, to transform the linguistic into the literary by means of computation…”</em> -- Davin Heckman & James O’Sullivan</p>

 <img src="tacoma.png" alt="Tacoma Dome.">
   
    <p>English 249 is a course designed to explore <em>special projects in creative writing</em>. This specific iteration of the course is about <em>electronic literature</em>. A key question guiding our work will be: What possibilities exist when the computer becomes an essential part of the asethetics of a literary work? To explore this question we will remix programs for generating poems, compose works of interactive fiction, and make literary bots. Throughout these projects you will document your composing and research processes, reflect on what you learn, and share your work within a community of peers.</p>

<p>This course is novice-friendly. No knowledge of computer programming required. If you are able to compose and edit text in an electronic document (MS Word, Google Doc, etc.) you have the technical competency required for this course.</p>

<p>I look forward to working and experimenting alongside you.</p>
      
<p><b>Questions?</b> Get in touch: jloan@pierce.ctc.edu or stop by my office in Cascade 357.<p>

<p>My office hours this quarter are Monday thru Thursday from 1 - 2 or by appointment.<p>
       
<p>The course consists of three major projects:</p>

<p><strong>LOG FOR WEEK 1</strong>: Introduce yourself. Entering the class chances are you have little or even no experience with Electronic Literature. What are you initial feelings, assumptions, wonderings as we begin class? Having read Heckman and O'Sullivan's "Electronic Literature: Contexts and Poetics" and "The Electronic Literature Timeline" -- what are your initial take aways? Describe your experience reading selections from the ELO's "Electronic Literature Collection" -- what do you make this work of electronic literature? What connections might you make between your initial assumptions or ideas about this this class or about "literature" or "creative writing" and your experience reading the text you selected? Finally, as best you can, attempt to articulate what you think you've learned this week.</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>

<p><strong>LOG FOR WEEK 2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, we discussed the question <i>what is literature? Now that you've made your own remix(es) of Monfort's Taroko Gorge, do you have any new insights or thoughts about this question, particularly as it might appl to electronic poetry? I mean, can something that deploys a gif be considered literature? ;-) Why? Why not?</li>
<li>Of what you read, which is your favorite remix of Taroko Gorge? Why?</li>
<li>As we begin or own remixes of Monfort's poem, describe your experience at peaking "behind the curtain" and tinkering with his text.</li>
<li>Again, as we begin our own remixes of Monfort's poem -- what are initial ideas for how to approach the project? What sense, if any, do you have of your own potential poem?</li>
<li>I haven't officially assigned any reading from <i>The Virtual Muse</i> yet, as I wanted to give you some initial experience in tinkering with a poetry program to help contextualize that reading a bit. You may, however, have gotten a start in reading it. I'm curious -- what's your initial take aways? What's most interesting/perplexing?</li>
<li>Finally, what do you think you've learned this week?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p><strong>M April 22</strong>: Begin further tweaks of TG remixes </p>

<p><strong>F April 26</strong>: Research Logs DUE | Assessments and self-evaluations | NO CLASS MEETING -- I'll be in Yakima for a meeting</p> 
<p><strong>LOG FOR WEEK 3</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Now that you've made your own electronic poem -- revisit the questions <i>what is literature?</i> Your remixes are made from potentialy very untraditional materials. Lanuage, sure. But also gifs and images and, as we've seen -- computer code. How has the experience of making these affected your sense of how we think about literarure and what it is.</li>
<li>Of your peers' remixes of Taroko Gorge, which is your favorite? Why?</li>
<li>I have asked you to take ownership of your remix, to approach each element of it with intentionality. Discuss your rationale for the choices you made in composing your TG Remix. For example, why that font? Background color? Language choices? Use of imgaes and gifs? 
<li>How do you feel about your own modifications/remix? Are you willing or interested in having it published via our class collection? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Finally, as best you can, attempt to articulate what you think you've learned this week?</li>
