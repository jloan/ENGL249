    <p><em>“…the goal of [electronic literature] remains consistent: to manipulate language, to transform the linguistic into the literary by means of computation…”</em> -- Davin Heckman & James O’Sullivan</p>

 <img src="tacoma.png" alt="Tacoma Dome.">
   
    <p>English 249 is a course designed to explore <em>special projects in creative writing</em>. This specific iteration of the course is about <em>electronic literature</em>. A key question guiding our work will be: What possibilities exist when the computer becomes an essential part of the asethetics of a literary work? To explore this question we will remix programs for generating poems, compose works of interactive fiction, and make literary bots. Throughout these projects you will document your composing and research processes, reflect on what you learn, and share your work within a community of peers.</p>

<p>This course is novice-friendly. No knowledge of computer programming required. If you are able to compose and edit text in an electronic document (MS Word, Google Doc, etc.) you have the technical competency required for this course.</p>

<p>I look forward to working and experimenting alongside you.</p>

<p>The course consists of three major projects:</p>
